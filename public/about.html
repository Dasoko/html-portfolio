<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Agu Somtochukwu but alot of people know me as Soko. I am an Architect by profession who is just starting out on his coding journey.</p>

<p>This is my very first website and I will be detailing my journey and work on here as I progress. CR7, Rocky Balboa and Obi-wan Kenobi are my icons and do you know one characteristic common to them all? Resilience! That is what I'm hoping to guide me through on my journey....along with The force ofcourse.</p>

<p>Come with me and Grow with me! ....Wait how do you insert an emoji in here?</p>
